Hello! this is the story of a cat named shebabwe. Shebabwe was a very UNUSUAL cat, because she had five paws. Seriously! she was a little bit awkward when she walked around on 5 paws, but once you got used to it, you just ignored the extra one. Shebabwe loved to eat cereal. She hated cat food. So, when her owners were fast asleep in bed, Shebabwe the cat would sneak in to the pantry and poop in the cat food. Also, it's important to know that Shebabwe had a flibidegibit on a shopbop.
