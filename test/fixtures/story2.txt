The flibidyjibbet had a flopbop. It was a very big flopbop, right where you wouldn't expect one to be held. The flopbop was sad. The flibidyjibbet was, too. It had been almost 250 years since the last time they saw their friend, the flibidynoggin. And in case you were thinking this is a kids' story: IT IS NOT. Because grown-ups don't even know flibidyjibbets or flopbops are amazing.

So anyway, when they had morning blop that day, with one cup to share, the flopbob had ample opportunity to express how thoroughly discouraged she was to the flibidyjibbet. And similarly, once everyone who shared the cup of blop had expressed their feelings, they all realized: something needed to be done about the universal lull.

So they did do something! They went to the bathroom. It was the most exciting bathroom adventure they'd ever sponsored! They gathered 3 entire packages of toilet paper, and piled them high, next to the toilet paper cannon. They replaced the regular old light bulbs with glowing pee bulbs (that didn't stink), and made sure to connect a lawn sprinkler to the hot water faucet.

Just as they were enjoying a hot water shower in a pee-colored bathroom with flying toilet paper, they flibidynoggin arrived! You should have seen their faces! One of the flibidynoggin's faces was appalled: it looked like they were about to turn green and blue with incomprehensible diasaster. The other face looked absolutely delighted to see such a grand party, and their friends, to boot! And so, the 3 of them all partied into the night.

THE END
